## Project Introduction
Our website project is a smart seat reservation and management system that integrates comprehensive user-centric and data-driven features. Users can register and log in via email, complete and modify personal basic information (including gender, identity as student or teacher, JCUID, and major), reset passwords, and view personal profiles showing upcoming reservations and frequently booked areas. Core reservation functions include browsing the live seat map, reserving or canceling seats, checking booking records with real-time status, and receiving booking notifications—each reservation generates a scannable QR code valid 15 minutes before and after the start time. For data monitoring and management, admin accounts can access seat data and mark damaged seats, while lecturers/tutors can view key metrics like booking rates and actual attendance rates. The platform also leverages advanced technologies: an ARIMA model provides booking forecast charts on the reservation page, AI-driven recommendations suggest seats based on user mood, learning objectives, and booking frequency, and a simulated real-time monitoring feature updates seat occupancy dynamically. Additionally, the homepage includes company introduction to deliver holistic user experience.
